        <h2>Malioboro: The street full of food & cultures.</h2>
        <p>Malioboro Street is one of the most visited places in the city of Yogyakarta. I got the chance to visit it with my friend during edutrip. The street is full of vendors and people selling, and at that moment I realized that Malioboro Street is full of bright cultures, different shops, and tasty local foods. The street feels alive like it’s talking to you with every step. The crowd moves like waves in the ocean. It’s a mix of fun and noise that makes your heart beat faster.
        </p>
        <h2>The culture stores in Malioboro</h2>
        <p>On the street in Malioboro, there are many unique stores and vendors. There were a lot of stores selling shirts and clothes from the cultures of Indonesia like batik. The shops seem to wave their hands, calling you to come in. The most popular souvenir that you will see everywhere is Tugu Jogja, a soft brownie filled with warm chocolate, like a sweet surprise in every bite. The colorful shirts look like a rainbow hanging in the air.
        </p>
        <h2>The Malioboro alley</h2>
        <p>While exploring the street, I got bored and went to take a look at the beautiful Malioboro alley. Inside the alley, the smells of food wrap around you like a big hug. There is a place full of food vendors selling different types of food from all over Indonesia. The alley feels like a happy party, with sounds of cooking and people laughing. It’s as if the food is calling your name, waiting for you to try everything.
        </p>
        <h2>The wide variety of food stores </h2>
        <p>While walking through the street, I saw many types of food. The smells of grilled meat and sweet sauces made my mouth water. There were even fast food places that my friends went to, like KFC, Burger King, and Wingstop. The street is like a big dining table filled with all kinds of food. Since it’s Ramadan, the street is busy with people looking for food to break their fast — like a race to find the best meal.
        <p>The next time you go to Malioboro just make sure you bring cash and some friends for the fun. You should also try the yummy foods from different cultures. The shops seem to smile at you, wanting you to come inside. Don’t be surprised if your wallet feels empty but your heart feels full. Malioboro is not just a street, it’s like a playground full of surprises, waiting for you to explore!
